# Kele

A Ruby Gem project that enables interaction with Bloc API (http://docs.blocapi.apiary.io/#).

This was a project that was a part of the Bloc.io Web Development Program.

While this demonstrates my ability to build a Ruby Gem and interact with Restful API's, all of the functionality requires a valid Bloc.io account.
